## Introduction: What is Texture?
There are no agreed definitions in the computer vision literature (cite). However, for texture, characterizing the spatial 
distribution of intensity and/or feature values is important.

## Problem Statement: Shortcomings of Convolutional Neural Networks
Convolutional neural networks have been vital for a variety of applications. Despite the innovations of CNN, these models are great at **structural** textures but not **statistical** textures. To illustrate this point, we show an example of different structural and statistical textures:
