## Research Interests
 Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Texture Analysis, Pattern Recognition, Computer Vision, Image Processing

## Summary
 Dr. Peeples has developed and refined novel deep learning methods for texture characterization, segmentation, and classification of images. His current research seeks to extend this work (e.g., other data modalities, multi-scale analysis) and explore new aspects such as developing algorithms for explainable artificial intelligence and various real-world applications in several domains (e.g., biomedical, agriculture). These methods can then be applied toward automated image understanding, object detection, and classification.
