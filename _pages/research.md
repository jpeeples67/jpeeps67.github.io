## Research Interests
 Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Texture Analysis, Pattern Recognition, Computer Vision, Image Processing

## Summary
 During my Ph.D. studies, I developed and refined novel deep learning methods for texture characterization, segmentation, and classification. My current research seeks to extend my dissertation work and explore new aspects such as developing algorithms for explainable AI and various real-world applications in other domains (e.g., biomedical, agriculture). These methods can then be applied toward automated image understanding, object detection, and classification.

## Current Research Projects

### Deep Learning for Texture Analysis

### Neural Handcrafted Features

## Past Research Projects

### Seafloor Segmentation for Office of Naval Research

### Histological Image Segmentation

### Sesame Root Architecture Analysis

### Bias in Machine Learning
