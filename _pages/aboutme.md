Hi! My name is Joshua Peeples (feel free to call me Josh). I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). After my graduation from UAB, I decided to pursue a [Ph.D. in Machine Learning](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/machine-learning/2017/03/welcome-new-phd-student-joshua-peeples/) at the
University of Florida (UF) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE). I worked with
[Dr. Alina Zare](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/machine-learning/people/faculty/) in the
[Machine Learning and Sensing Lab](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/machine-learning/machine-learning-sensing-lab/) to research and develop novel algorithms for a variety of applications.<br/>

Upon acceptance into the Ph.D. program, I was recognized with the UF Graduate School Preeminence Award, Iva and Norman Tucker UF Transportation Institute Fellowship, UF Board of Education Summer Fellowship and the Florida Education Fund's McKnight Doctoral Fellowship. In 2018, I was also blessed to receive the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. In addition to research, I was activately involved in graduate student organizations and outreach opportunities.<br/>

After earning my Ph.D., I was selected for the [Accountability, Climate, Equity, and Scholarship (ACES) Fellows Program](https://diversity.tamu.edu/Home/Accountability,-Climate,-Equity,-and-Scholarship-F) at Texas A&M University (TAMU). I joined the [TAMU ECE Department](https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/profiles/peeples-joshua.html) as an ACES Faculty Fellow and will later transition to the Tenure-Track Assistant Professor role (expected Fall 2024). I am leading my [research lab](https://peepleslab.engr.tamu.edu/) and teaching courses to advance the knowledge and understanding in the areas of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision.<br/>
